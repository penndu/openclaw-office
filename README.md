# OpenClaw Office

> [中文文档](./README.zh.md)

> Visualize AI agent collaboration as a real-time digital twin office.

**OpenClaw Office** is the visual monitoring and management frontend for the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) Multi-Agent system. It renders Agent work status, collaboration links, tool calls, and resource consumption through an isometric-style virtual office scene, along with a full-featured console for system management.

**Core Metaphor:** Agent = Digital Employee | Office = Agent Runtime | Desk = Session | Meeting Pod = Collaboration Context

> **Remote Gateway Ready**  
> OpenClaw Office now supports remote OpenClaw Gateway onboarding through the same `/gateway-ws` proxy flow used for local deployments. Aliyun, Tencent Cloud, and other hosted OpenClaw environments can be connected directly from the first-launch setup UI by pasting the access URL. If the URL contains a token, Office extracts it automatically.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **pnpm** (package manager)
- **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** installed and configured

OpenClaw Office is a companion frontend that connects to a running OpenClaw Gateway. It does **not** start or manage the Gateway itself.

---

## Quick Launch

The fastest way to run OpenClaw Office — no cloning required:

```bash
# Run directly (one-time)
npx @ww-ai-lab/openclaw-office

# Or install globally
npm install -g @ww-ai-lab/openclaw-office
openclaw-office
```

### Remote Gateway Support

OpenClaw Office supports both:

- **Local Gateway** — connect to the default Gateway running on your machine or LAN
- **Remote Gateway** — connect to hosted OpenClaw environments such as **Aliyun**, **Tencent Cloud**, or any other public/private deployment

At first launch, Office shows a connection setup dialog. The browser always connects through the same-origin `/gateway-ws` proxy, while the local Node proxy forwards traffic to the selected local or remote Gateway target.

### Gateway Token Auto-Detection

If [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is installed locally, the Gateway auth token is **automatically detected** from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — no manual configuration needed.

You can also provide the token explicitly:

```bash
openclaw-office --token <your-gateway-token>
# or via environment variable
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<token> openclaw-office
```

### CLI Options

| Flag                  | Description           | Default                |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `-t, --token <token>` | Gateway auth token    | auto-detected          |
| `-g, --gateway <url>` | Gateway WebSocket URL | `ws://localhost:18789` |
| `-p, --port <port>`   | Server port           | `5180`                 |
| `--host <host>`       | Bind address          | `0.0.0.0`              |
| `-h, --help`          | Show help             | —                      |

The production server exposes Office publicly and proxies browser WebSocket traffic through the same origin path `/gateway-ws`. Its upstream Gateway address is resolved in this order:

1. `--gateway`
2. `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`
3. persisted Office config at `~/.openclaw/openclaw-office.json`
4. default `ws://localhost:18789`

When `--gateway` or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` is provided, Office automatically persists the value to `~/.openclaw/openclaw-office.json` for future restarts.

> **Note:** This serves the pre-built production bundle. For development with hot reload, see [Development](#development) below.

---

## Quick Start (from source)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Gateway Connection

Create a `.env.local` file (gitignored) with your Gateway token. `VITE_GATEWAY_URL` is optional and only needed if you want dev mode to proxy to a Gateway address other than the default `ws://localhost:18789`.

```bash
cat > .env.local << 'EOF'
VITE_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<your-gateway-token>
EOF
```

Get your Gateway token:

```bash
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
```

### 3. Enable Device Auth Bypass (Required)

OpenClaw Office is a pure web application and cannot provide Ed25519 device identity signatures that Gateway 2026.2.15+ requires for operator scopes. You must configure the Gateway to bypass this requirement:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth true
```

**Restart the Gateway** after this configuration change.

> **Security Note:** This bypass is intended for local development. In production, use a reverse proxy or other secure authentication mechanism.

### 4. Start the Gateway

Ensure the OpenClaw Gateway is running on the configured address (default `localhost:18789`). You can start it via:

- The OpenClaw macOS app
- `openclaw gateway run` CLI command
- Other deployment methods (see [OpenClaw documentation](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw))

### 5. Start the Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5180` in your browser. In dev mode, the frontend always connects to the same-origin path `/gateway-ws`, and Vite proxies that path to the configured Gateway upstream (default `ws://localhost:18789`). `VITE_GATEWAY_URL` configures the proxy upstream and is not used as a browser-direct websocket URL.

### Environment Variables

| Variable             | Required                              | Default                | Description                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `VITE_GATEWAY_URL`   | No                                    | `ws://localhost:18789` | Optional override for the dev proxy upstream Gateway address |
| `VITE_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | Yes (when connecting to real Gateway) | —                      | Gateway auth token                   |
| `VITE_MOCK`          | No                                    | `false`                | Enable mock mode (no Gateway needed) |

### Mock Mode (No Gateway)

To develop without a running Gateway, enable mock mode:

```bash
VITE_MOCK=true pnpm dev
```

This uses simulated Agent data for UI development.

## Development

### Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # Install dependencies
pnpm dev                  # Start dev server (port 5180)
pnpm build                # Production build
pnpm test                 # Run tests
pnpm test:watch           # Test watch mode
pnpm typecheck            # TypeScript type check
pnpm lint                 # Oxlint linting
pnpm format               # Oxfmt formatting
pnpm check                # lint + format check
```

### Architecture

OpenClaw Office connects to the Gateway via WebSocket and follows this data flow:

```
OpenClaw Gateway  ──WebSocket──>  ws-client.ts  ──>  event-parser.ts  ──>  Zustand Store  ──>  React Components
     │                                                                          │
     └── RPC (agents.list, chat.send, ...)  ──>  rpc-client.ts  ──────────────>─┘
```

The Gateway broadcasts real-time events (`agent`, `presence`, `health`, `heartbeat`) and responds to RPC requests. The frontend maps Agent lifecycle events to visual states (idle, working, speaking, tool_calling, error) and renders them in the office scene.
